# engineering-quiz-java/requestbin

How to code for this exercise: 
This basic java repository has been created as a framework for you to complete a simple web endpoint to see what your 
HTTP client is sending and to inspect/debug webhook requests. 

Complete the Bin.java, Request.java, BinController.java, RequestbinApplication.java, BinControllerTest, and 
RequestbinApplicationTests.java files to create a REST endpoint that answers with a JSON response. 

Jackson (a parser/writer for JSON <-> JAVA) is provided for you and you should not need to make any changes to it. If you would like to learn more about it, docs are 
available [here] (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson). 

All tests should execute successfully.
