# engineering-quiz-java
A selection of tests for candidates to Revinate engineering (Java development)

Hello! Thanks for applying to Revinate! 

These quizzes are designed to take less than an hour for a beginning
/intermediate Java developer to complete. Primarily, they are meant to 
give us an idea of your coding style and thought process. More detailed 
instructions for each quiz can be found under each directory.  

No non-native libraries will be necessary to solve the problems provided. 
If you would like to import a library for purposes of testing, feel free.  

You may choose from 4 different quizzes to complete: 

1. minesweeper: complete a class to control the inner mechanics of this
classic game. 
2. ticketer: sell a finite number of tickets to would-be concert goers. 
3. requestbin: set up a simple mock-server to provide web responses.
4. instagram: create a minimal version of instagram

If you are enjoying them, feel free to complete all three!
